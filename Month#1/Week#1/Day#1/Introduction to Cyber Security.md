# Introduction to Cyber Security
## What is Cyber Security :
* Cyber security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyber attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.
                                                                               
* Computer security, cyber security, or information technology security is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide .

Cybersecurity can be categorized into five distinct types:
*	Critical infrastructure security
*	Application security
*	Network security
*	Cloud security
*	Internet of Things (IoT) security
 # Why we need Cybersecurity?
 * It can be rightfully said that today’s generation lives on the internet, and we general users are almost ignorant as to how those random bits of 1’s and 0’s reach securely to our computer. For a hacker, it’s a golden age. With so many access points, public IP’s and constant traffic and tons of data to exploit, black hat hackers, are having one hell of a time exploiting vulnerabilities and creating malicious software for the same. Above that, cyber-attacks are evolving by the day. Hackers are becoming smarter and more creative with their malware and how they bypass virus scans and firewalls still baffles many people.
# Types of Cyber Attacks
## Malware
* What is Malware :
Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is intentionally harmful to a computer, network or server.
Types of malware include computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware and spyware. These malicious programs steal, encrypt and delete sensitive data; alter or hijack core computing functions and monitor end users' computer activity
* What does malware do?
Malware can infect networks and devices and is designed to harm those devices, networks and/or their users in some way.
## How do malware infections happen?
Malware authors use a variety of physical and virtual means to spread malware that infects devices and networks. For example, malicious programs can be delivered to a system with a USB drive, through popular collaboration tools and by drive-by downloads, which automatically download malicious programs to systems without the user's approval or knowledge.
## What are the different types of malware?
Different types of malware have unique traits and characteristics. Types of malware include the following:
*	A virus is the most common type of malware that can execute itself and spread by infecting other programs or files.
*	A worm can self-replicate without a host program and typically spreads without any interaction from the malware authors.
*	A Trojan horse is designed to appear as a legitimate software program to gain access to a system. Once activated following installation, Trojans can execute their malicious functions.
*	Spyware collects information and data on the device and user, as well as observes the user's activity without their knowledge.
*	Ransomware infects a user's system and encrypts its data. Cybercriminals then demand a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for decrypting the system's data.
*	A rootkit obtains administrator-level access to the victim's system. Once installed, the program gives threat actors root or privileged access to the system.
*	A backdoor virus or remote access Trojan (RAT) secretly creates a backdoor into an infected computer system that enables threat actors to remotely access it without alerting the user or the system's security programs.
*	Adware tracks a user's browser and download history with the intent to display pop-up or banner advertisements that lure the user into making a purchase. For example, an advertiser might use cookies to track the webpages a user visits to better target advertising.
*	Keyloggers, also called system monitors, track nearly everything a user does on their computer. This includes emails, opened webpages, programs and keystrokes.
 # What is Phishing? 
Phishing is a type of online fraud that involves tricking people into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, by masquerading as a trustworthy source. Phishing can be done through email, social media or malicious websites.
# Types of Phishing Attacks
## Spear Phishing 
* A Spear Phishing attack occurs when a phishing attempt is crafted to trick a specific person rather than a group of people. The attackers either already know some information about the target, or they aim to gather that information to advance their objectives. Once personal details are obtained, such as a birthday, the phishing attempt is tailored to incorporate that personal detail(s) in order to appear more legitimate. These attacks are typically more successful because they are more believable. In other words, this type of attack has much more context (as outlined by the NIST Phish Scale) that is relevant to the target. 
## Whaling 
* Whaling is a sub-type of Spear Phishing and is typically even more targeted. The difference is that Whaling is targeted to specific individuals such as business executives, celebrities, and high-net-worth individuals. The account credentials of these high-value targets typically provide a gateway to more information and potentially money.  
## Smishing 
* Smishing is a type of phishing attack deployed via SMS message. This type of phishing attack gets more visibility because of the notification the individual receives and because more people are likely to read a text message than an email. With the rising popularity of SMS messaging between consumers and businesses, Smishing has been increasingly popular. There was also an increase in this type of phishing during the 2020 presidential election. 
## Vishing 
* Vishing is a type of attack carried out via phone call. The attackers call the victim, usually with a pre-recorded message or a script. In a recent Twitter breach, a group of hackers pretending to be “IT Staff” were able to convince Twitter employees to hand over credentials all through phone conversations.  
# How to avoid attacks on your organization 
* Organizations cannot assume users are knowledgeable and capable of detecting these malicious phishing attempts — especially as phishing attacks continue to get more sophisticated. Users should be regularly trained on the types of attacks they could be susceptible to and taught how to detect, avoid and report the attacks. ## The following are two simple methods of educating employees and training them to be more vigilant. 
*	Regular Security Awareness & Phishing Training 
*	Internal Phishing Campaigns and Phishing Simulations 
#	What is a password attack?
* Well, it’s a type of cyber attack where hackers attempt to access a file, folder, account, or computer secured with a password. 
*	It’s generally done with the help of software that expedites cracking or guessing passwords. That’s why following a secure practice when creating passwords is vital, like avoiding using your pet’s name, nicknames, apartment address, etc. These go-to passwords are too obvious, easy to guess, and successfully breach—, especially by those who know you personally.
#	How Does a Password Attack Work?
*	Password attacks in cybersecurity require special techniques and software. If a hacker is close to you, they may try guessing your password using a combination of names, hobbies, essential years, or numbers.
*	If that doesn’t work, they use specialized applications that scan through a list of words many people use as passwords. Surprisingly, over 75% of the internet population set passwords consisting of the first 500 words only. 
*	With this in mind, imagine how easy it is for malicious actors to gain access to your crucial information!
*	That’s why two-factor authentication has become a necessity, adding an extra layer of security. 
#	Example of Password Attacks
*	In January 2021, quiz website DailyQuiz (formerly ThisCrush) suffered a password attack where attackers exploited a database of more than 13 million accounts. The hackers stole plaintext passwords, email addresses, and IP addresses and put them on sale in the public domain.
*	A plaintext password is a way of sending or storing passwords in a clearly readable format. It’s extremely risky to store sensitive user details in plaintext format.

# What is DDoS Attack?
*  DDoS Attack means "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack" and it is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.
*  Motivations for carrying out a DDoS vary widely, as do the types of individuals and organizations eager to perpetrate this form of cyberattack. Some attacks are carried out by disgruntled individuals and hacktivists wanting to take down a company's servers simply to make a statement, have fun by exploiting cyber weakness, or express disapproval.
# Types of DDoS Attacks
*  Different attacks target different parts of a network, and they are classified according to the network connection layers they target. A connection on the internet is comprised of seven different “layers," as defined by the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model created by the International Organization for Standardization. The model allows different computer systems to be able to "talk" to each other.
## Volume-Based or Volumetric Attacks
* This type of attack aims to control all available bandwidth between the victim and the larger internet. Domain name system (DNS) amplification is an example of a volume-based attack. In this scenario, the attacker spoofs the target's address, then sends a DNS name lookup request to an open DNS server with the spoofed address.
* When the DNS server sends the DNS record response, it is sent instead to the target, resulting in the target receiving an amplification of the attacker’s initially small query.
## Protocol Attacks
* Protocol attacks consume all available capacity of web servers or other resources, such as firewalls. They expose weaknesses in Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI protocol stack to render the target inaccessible. 
* A SYN flood is an example of a protocol attack, in which the attacker sends the target an overwhelming number of transmission control protocol (TCP) handshake requests with spoofed source Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The targeted servers attempt to respond to each connection request, but the final handshake never occurs, overwhelming the target in the process.
## Application-Layer Attacks
* These attacks also aim to exhaust or overwhelm the target's resources but are difficult to flag as malicious. Often referred to as a Layer 7 DDoS attack—referring to Layer 7 of the OSI model—an application-layer attack targets the layer where web pages are generated in response to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests. 
* A server runs database queries to generate a web page. In this form of attack, the attacker forces the victim's server to handle more than it normally does. An HTTP flood is a type of application-layer attack and is similar to constantly refreshing a web browser on different computers all at once. In this manner, the excessive number of HTTP requests overwhelms the server, resulting in a DDoS.
# Man-in-the-middle (MITM) Attacks
## What is MITM Attack
*  A MITM attack is a form of cyber-attack where a user is introduced with some kind of meeting between the two parties by a malicious individual, manipulates both parties and achieves access to the data that the two people were trying to deliver to each other. A man-in-the-middle attack also helps a malicious attacker, without any kind of participant recognizing till it's too late, to hack the transmission of data intended for someone else and not supposed to be sent at all. In certain aspects, like MITM, MitM, MiM or MIM, MITM attacks can be referred.
If an attacker puts himself between a client and a webpage, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs. This form of assault comes in many different ways.
## For example:
In order to intercept financial login credentials, a fraudulent banking website can be used. Between the user and the real bank webpage, the fake site lies "in the middle."
## How does MITM work
There are several reasons and strategies for hackers to use a MITM attack. Usually, like credit card numbers or user login details, they try to access anything. They also spy on private meetings, which may include corporate secrets or other useful information.
# The CIA Triad
The CIA triad which stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability is a design model to guide companies and organizations to form their security policies. It is also known as the AIC triad to avoid confusion with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The components of the triad are considered to be the most important and fundamental components of security. So let me brief you all about the three components 
## Confidentiality
* Confidentiality is the protection of personal information. Confidentiality means keeping a client’s information between you and the client, and not telling others including co-workers, friends, family, etc. 
## Integrity
* Integrity, in the context of computer systems, refers to methods of ensuring that data is real, accurate and safeguarded from unauthorized user modification.
## Availability
* Availability, in the context of a computer system, refers to the ability of a user to access information or resources in a specified location and in the correct format.
# How is Cybersecurity implemented?
* There are numerous procedures for actually implementing cybersecurity, but there three main steps when actually fixing a security-related issue. 
The first step is to recognize the problem that is causing the security issue, for example, we have to recognize whether there is a denial of service attack or a man in the middle attack. The next step is to evaluate and analyze the problem. We have to make sure we isolate all the data and information that may have been compromised in the attack. Finally, after evaluating and analyzing the problem, the last step is to develop a patch that actually solves the problem and brings back the organization to a running state. 
When identifying, analyzing and treating a cyber attack, there are three principals that are kept in mind for various calculations. They are:
*	Vulnerability
*	Threat
*	Risk
