# What is Ethical Hacking?
* Ethical hacking is the process of locating weaknesses or vulnerabilities in computers and information systems using the intent and actions of malicious hackers. # There are two types of hackers: 

## Malicious hacker: 
* This hacker hacks with a malicious intent to do damage to the victim
## Ethical hacker:
* This hacker hacks using the same method but passes on the vulnerabilities to the security department
# Ethical Hacker Responsibilities
Here are some responsibilities of an ethical hacker:

* Create scripts that test for vulnerabilities
* Develop tools to increase security
* Perform risk assessment
* Setup security policies
* Train staff for network security
## Now that we have seen what ethical hacking and the roles of an ethical hacker is, it’s time to learn about penetration testing.

# What is Penetration Testing?
* Penetration testing which is also known as pen-test is a part of ethical hacking, where it focuses explicitly on penetrating only the information systems. Now, how is penetration testing different from ethical hacking? Penetration testing focuses exclusively on information systems, while ethical hacking is a broad area to protect the systems. Ethical hacking has more job roles and responsibilities than penetration testing. 

## Now that we have understood the difference between ethical hacking and penetration testing let’s take a look at the platform used by ethical hackers.

# What is Kali Linux?
* Kali Linux is a Debian-based operating system with advanced penetration testing and security auditing features. Most hackers also use this platform. Kali contains hundreds of tools which are used for various information security tasks like computer forensics and reverse engineering. The main features of Kali Linux include:

* 600+ tools
* Open-source
* Mass customization
* Wide range wireless support
* Multi-language support
* Fast injections
## Now, let’s cover the phases of ethical hacking and penetration testing
# Phases of Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing
To carry out a structured attack, ethical hacking employs various phases. These are: 

## Reconnaissance: 
* The attacker uses various hacking tools (NMAP, Hping) to obtain information about the target
## Scanning: 
* Using tools such as NMAP and Nexpose, the attacker tries to spot vulnerabilities in the system
## Gain access:
* Here, the attacker attempts to exploit the vulnerability using the Metasploit tool
## Maintain access:
* Now, the attacker tries to install some backdoors into the victim’s system for future access (Metasploit is used again to achieve this)
## Clear tracks: 
* In this stage, the attacker clears all evidence of the attack as no attacker likes to get caught
## Reporting: 
* Finally, the ethical hacker documents a report which consists of the vulnerabilities spotted, the tools used to exploit, and the success rate of the operation
## Now that we know about the process involved in ethical hacking let’s learn about the areas in penetration testing.

# Areas of Penetration Testing
## Network services:
* It finds weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the security of the network infrastructure (for example, firewall testing)
## Web application: 
* Security vulnerabilities or weaknesses will get discovered in web-based applications (for example, Outlook)
## Client-side:
* It finds vulnerabilities in software on a client computer, such as an employee workstation (for example, media player)
## Wireless: 
* This test examines all the wireless devices which are used in a corporation (for example, tablets or smartphones)
## Social engineering:
* Getting confidential information by tricking an employee of the corporation to reveal such items (for example, phishing)
## After learning about the areas of penetration testing, let’s see some tools that are used for this process.

# Penetration Testing Tools
These are some of the more popular tools that are frequently used by hackers:

* BeEF
* Metasploit
* NMAP
* Nessus Vulnerability Scanner
* WIRESHARK
* SQLMap
* BackTrack
* John the Ripper
# What does Penetration testing involve
To uncover the vulnerabilities which can be found in type or kind of Web Application, there are three types of Pen Testing which can be used, which are as follows:

* Black Box Testing;
* White Box Testing;
* Gray Box Testing.
# Black box penetration testing
* In a real-world Cyber-attack, the hacker probably will not know all of the ins and outs of the IT infrastructure of a corporation. Because of this, he or she will launch an all-out, brute force attack against the IT infrastructure, in the hopes of trying to find a vulnerability or weakness on which they latch onto.

* In other words, in this type of Pen Test, there is no information given to the tester about the internal workings of the particular Web Application, nor about its source code or software architecture. As a result, this particular type of test can take a very long time to complete, so very often, the tester will rely upon the use of automated processes to completely uncover the weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This type of test is also referred to as the “trial and error” approach.

# White box penetration testing
* In this type of Pen test, also known as “Clear Box Testing,” the tester has full knowledge and access to both the source code and software architecture of the Web Application. Because of this, a White Box Test can be accomplished in a much quicker time frame when compared to a Black Box Test. The other advantage of this is that a much more thorough Pen Test can be completed.

* But, this approach also has its set of disadvantages. First, since a tester has complete knowledge, it could take more time to decide on what to focus specifically on regarding system and component testing and analysis. Second, to conduct this type of test, more sophisticated tools are required such as that of software code analyzers and debuggers.

# Gray box Penetration testing
* As the name implies, this type of test is a combination of both the Black Box and the White Box Test. In other words, the penetration tester only has partial knowledge of the internal workings of the Web Applications. This is often restricted to just getting access to the software code and system architecture diagrams.

* With the Gray Box Test, both manual and automated testing processes can be utilized. Because of this approach, a pen tester can focus their main efforts focus on those areas of the Web Application, which he or she knows the most about, and from there, exploit any weaknesses or vulnerabilities. With this particular method, there is a higher probability that more hard-to-find “security holes” will also be discovered as well.

# The Penetration testing teams
## Very often, when it comes, Pen Testing, the image of just one person doing the test is conjured up. But keep in mind, the best types of Pen Testing come into play when multiple testers are utilized and are broken down into three teams, which are as follows:

* The Red Team
* The Blue Team
* The Purple Team
# The Red team
* The Red Team can be considered as those individuals who are the actual Pen Testers. Their primary goal and objective are to mimic or emulate the mindset of an attacker, trying to break down through all of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities which are present. In other words, it is the Red Team which attacks all fronts possible.

# The Blue team
* The Blue Team can be considered that personnel from within the infrastructure of the business itself. This can be the IT Security team, and their primary goal and objective are to thwart off and defend against any attacks from the Red Team. It is important that anybody participating on the Blue Team must possess the mindset of constant proactiveness and vigilance to defend the corporation against any and all attacks.

* If you think about it, both the Red Team and Blue Team can be viewed as the two sides of a particular coin, or the Ying and the Yang. The summation goal of these two teams is great to enhance the security posture of the corporation on a constant basis, by sharing feedback with another. However, this does not always happen. Thus there is the need for the Purple Team.

# The Purple team
* The Purple Team can be viewed as the composite of both the Red Team and the Blue Team. In other words, the Purple Team adopts the security controls and tactics from the Blue Team, as well as the security weaknesses and vulnerabilities which are discovered by the Red Team. This is then all translated into a one, single narrative which can be shared across all of the teams fully to implement a policy of continuous and constant security improvements for the corpora

*In other words, the Purple Team can be viewed as literally the “bridge” between the Red Team and the Blue Team, to help instill a sense of continuous integration amongst the two. To fully ensure that the Purple Team is providing the most robust lines of communication and information, it should remain as a separate entity and neutral of all views and circumstances, so there is no bias.
