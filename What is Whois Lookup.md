# Whois lookup

* Is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with them. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain name registration and ownership. Whois records have proven to be extremely useful and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the integrity of the domain name registration and website ownership process.

# What is in a Whois record?

A Whois record contains all of the contact information associated with the person, group, or company that registers a particular domain name. Typically, each Whois record will contain information such as the name and contact information of the Registrant (who owns the domain), the name and contact information of the registrar Registrar (the organization or commercial entity that registered the domain name), the registration dates, the name servers, the most recent update, and the expiration date. Whois records may also provide the administrative and technical contact information (which is often, but not always, the registrant).

# Whois Thick and Thin Models

## There are two different data models for storing Whois resource information:

* **Thin Model. Thin Whois lookup only gives the registrar, name servers and registration dates. To acquire additional information, a secondary lookup at the registrar on file is necessary to attain full information on domain name ownership.**
* **Thick Model. A thick Whois provides useful additional details beyond what is contained in a thin Whois record. Typically, the additional details contain contact (registrant, administrative, and technical) information. A lookup, then, will supply all the necessary information on who owns the domain, where it is registered, what name servers it uses, when it was registered and when it may expire.**
* It takes a lot of effort to track down Whois information given the large number of registrars and Whois servers out there. DomainTools makes it easy to find Whois information in one spot. Our Whois Lookup is a great place to start.
The purpose and value of the data in the Whois system has evolved in a number of ways over time including:
