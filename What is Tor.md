# What is Tor? Anchor link

* Tor is a volunteer-run service that provides both privacy and anonymity online by masking who you are and where you are connecting. The service also protects you from the Tor network itself—you can have good assurance that you’ll remain anonymous to other Tor users.

* Tor—short for the Onion Routing project—is an open-source privacy network that enables anonymous web browsing. The worldwide Tor computer network uses secure, encrypted protocols to ensure that users' online privacy is protected. Tor users' digital data and communications are shielded using a layered approach that resembles the nested layers of an onion.

* The Tor technology was initially developed and solely used by the U.S. Navy to protect sensitive government communications. The network was later made available to the public as an open-source platform, meaning that Tor's source code is accessible to everyone. Tor is upgraded and enhanced by volunteer developers in the Tor network.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS

* The Tor network is a secure, encrypted protocol that can ensure privacy for data and communications on the web.
* Short for the Onion Routing project, the system uses a series of layered nodes to hide IP addresses, online data, and browsing history.
* Originally developed by the U.S. government, critics consider Tor to be dangerous in the hands of some people, who may use the Tor network for illegal or unethical purposes.

# HOW TOR WORKS
* Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows you to improve your privacy and security on the Internet. Tor works by sending your traffic through three random servers (also known as relays) in the Tor network. The last relay in the circuit (the “exit relay”) then sends the traffic out onto the public Internet.

**The image above illustrates a user browsing to different websites over Tor. The green middle computers represent relays in the Tor network, while the three keys represent the layers of encryption between the user and each relay.**

## Explanation
Tor uses an onion-style routing technique for transmitting data. When you use the Tor browser to digitally communicate or access a website, the Tor network does not directly connect your computer to that website. Instead, the traffic from your browser is intercepted by Tor and bounced to a random number of other Tor users’ computers before passing the request to its final website destination.
* **Many dark web enterprises and activities are only accessible via Tor.**

# Who Uses Tor and Why

Though Tor is best known for its illicit uses, many Internet users can have different, valid reasons for accessing the Internet via Tor.

## Let's take a closer look at who uses Tor and why:

### Government agencies: 
* Tor can protect and securely share sensitive government information.
### For-profit enterprises: 
* Companies that use Tor can benefit from increased data privacy and security.
### Illicit organizations: 
* Criminals sometimes use Tor to shield their online activity.
### Private individuals: 
* Anyone wishing for more online privacy and better cybersecurity can benefit from the Tor browser. Journalists, activists, and people facing censorship may choose to interact online via Tor.
