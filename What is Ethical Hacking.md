# Explanation
The term ‘Hacker’ was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe systems, increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or using bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. 
##For example:
* A hacker can create algorithms to crack passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services.
# What is Ethical Hacking?
* Ethical hacking is an authorized practice of detecting vulnerabilities in an application, system, or organization’s infrastructure and bypassing system security to identify potential data breaches and threats in a network. Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They can improve the security footprint to withstand attacks better or divert them.

* The company that owns the system or network allows Cyber Security engineers to perform such activities in order to test the system’s defenses. Thus, unlike malicious hacking, this process is planned, approved, and more importantly, legal.

* Ethical hackers aim to investigate the system or network for weak points that malicious hackers can exploit or destroy. They collect and analyze the information to figure out ways to strengthen the security of the system/network/applications. By doing so,  they can improve the security footprint so that it can better withstand attacks or divert them.

* Ethical hackers are hired by organizations to look into the vulnerabilities of their systems and networks and develop solutions to prevent data breaches. Consider it a high-tech permutation of the old saying “It takes a thief to catch a thief.”

# They check for key vulnerabilities include but are not limited to:

* Injection attacks
* Changes in security settings
* Exposure of sensitive data
* Breach in authentication protocols
* Components used in the system or network that may be used as access points
## Now, as you have an idea of what is ethical hacking, it's time to learn the type of hackers.

# What are the Different Types of Hackers?
* The practice of ethical hacking is called “White Hat” hacking, and those who perform it are called White Hat hackers. In contrast to Ethical Hacking, “Black Hat” hacking describes practices involving security violations. The Black Hat hackers use illegal techniques to compromise the system or destroy information.

* Unlike White Hat hackers, “Grey Hat” hackers don’t ask for permission before getting into your system. But Grey Hats are also different from Black Hats because they don’t perform hacking for any personal or third-party benefit. These hackers do not have any malicious intention and hack systems for fun or various other reasons, usually informing the owner about any threats they find. Grey Hat and Black Hat hacking are both illegal as they both constitute an unauthorized system breach, even though the intentions of both types of hackers differ.

# White Hat Hacker vs Black Hat Hacker 
* The best way to differentiate between White Hat and Black Hat hackers is by taking a look at their motives. Black Hat hackers are motivated by malicious intent, manifested by personal gains, profit, or harassment; whereas White Hat hackers seek out and remedy vulnerabilities, so as to prevent Black Hats from taking advantage.

# The other ways to draw a distinction between White Hat and Black Hat hackers include:

## Techniques Used
* White Hat hackers duplicate the techniques and methods followed by malicious hackers in order to find out the system discrepancies, replicating all the latter’s steps to find out how a system attack occurred or may occur. If they find a weak point in the system or network, they report it immediately and fix the flaw.
## Legality
* Even though White Hat hacking follows the same techniques and methods as Black Hat hacking, only one is legally acceptable. Black Hat hackers break the law by penetrating systems without consent.
## Ownership
* White Hat hackers are employed by organizations to penetrate their systems and detect security issues. Black hat hackers neither own the system nor work for someone who owns it.
## After understanding what is ethical hacking, the types of ethical hackers, and knowing the difference between white-hat and black-hat hackers, let's have a look at the ethical hacker roles and responsibilities.

# What are the Roles and Responsibilities of an Ethical Hacker?
* Ethical Hackers must follow certain guidelines in order to perform hacking legally. A good hacker knows his or her responsibility and adheres to all of the ethical guidelines. Here are the most important rules of Ethical Hacking:

* An ethical hacker must seek authorization from the organization that owns the system. Hackers should obtain complete approval before performing any security assessment on the system or network.
* Determine the scope of their assessment and make known their plan to the organization.
* Report any security breaches and vulnerabilities found in the system or network.
* Keep their discoveries confidential. As their purpose is to secure the system or network, ethical hackers should agree to and respect their non-disclosure agreement.
* Erase all traces of the hack after checking the system for any vulnerability. It prevents malicious hackers from entering the system through the identified loopholes.
# Key Benefits of Ethical Hacking
* Learning ethical hacking involves studying the mindset and techniques of black hat hackers and testers to learn how to identify and correct vulnerabilities within networks. Studying ethical hacking can be applied by security pros across industries and in a multitude of sectors. This sphere includes network defender, risk management, and quality assurance tester. 

* However, the most obvious benefit of learning ethical hacking is its potential to inform and improve and defend corporate networks. The primary threat to any organization's security is a hacker: learning, understanding, and implementing how hackers operate can help network defenders prioritize potential risks and learn how to remediate them best. Additionally, getting ethical hacking training or certifications can benefit those who are seeking a new role in the security realm or those wanting to demonstrate skills and quality to their organization.

* You understood what is ethical hacking, and the various roles and responsibilities of an ethical hacker, and you must be thinking about what skills you require to become an ethical hacker. So, let's have a look at some of the ethical hacker skills.

* Skills Required to Become an Ethical Hacker
An ethical hacker should have in-depth knowledge about all the systems, networks, program codes, security measures, etc. to perform hacking efficiently. 
## Some of these skills include:

## Knowledge of programming - 
* It is required for security professionals working in the field of application security and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
## Scripting knowledge - 
* This is required for professionals dealing with network-based attacks and host-based attacks.
## Networking skills - 
* This skill is important because threats mostly originate from networks. You should know about all of the devices present in the network, how they are connected, and how to identify if they are compromised.
## Understanding of databases - 
* Attacks are mostly targeted at databases. Knowledge of database management systems such as SQL will help you to effectively inspect operations carried out in databases.
## Knowledge of multiple platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.
## The ability to work with different hacking tools available in the market.
## Knowledge of search engines and servers.
# Importance of Ethical Hacking:
* Today the biggest asset of any business is its “DATA”; therefore, ensuring that the data is safe and sound is the first and foremost priority of any business.

* Whether we look at government firms or private firms the amount of data generated on day-to-day basis is huge. Hence, the chances are very high that their sensitive data can be targeted by cyber criminals or hackers or even terrorist groups. The fear of getting hacked has forced the organizations to take preventive security measures which can rest assure them that the data is safe and protected.

* Irrespective of the size of the business, organizations globally must take proactive measures like updating the security on daily basis as everyday hackers keep looking out for new ways to penetrate through the barriers of firewalls.

* Ethical hackers or White hat hackers have adapted new approach to safety. They perform pen testing to evaluate the security measures of the organization. In simple words they hack the systems of the organization and provide complete & detailed information about the organization’s security posture.

* This helps the organization to understand the approach of a hacker which makes them further alert and also reduces the chances of actual threats like data theft. Also when we can understand how a hacker can act then accordingly we can update our security measures. All this gives the organization a confidence that the walls build for its data security are thick and strong enough.

# Various Types of Ethical Hacking:
## Web Application Hacking :
* A Web application is an application which is accessed by the users over a network. When an application is exploited by using HTTP i.e. either done by manipulating the application via graphical web interface or by tampering the URI or HTTP elements that are not contained in the URI, this is known as web application hacking.

## Social Engineering :
* It is a technique used by hackers to manipulate the end users and gain information about the organization or computer systems. IT security professionals must understand the concept of social engineering to protect their networks. For instance, who can get targeted? And how social engineering attacks are adapted?

## System Hacking :
* Through system hacking, the hackers find out ways to gain access for the individual computers on a network. It enables the ethical hackers to detect, prevent and counter these types of attacks.

## Hacking Wireless Network :
* Wireless hacking can also be termed as wireless sniffing. Sniffing is the process of capturing and monitoring all the wireless packets from a particular network. Email passwords, FTP passwords, chat sessions can be sniffed. For example few clients (monitors) are connected to a common access point in order to sniff all wireless traffic to this access point; one can put their W90 interface into monitor mode.

## Web Server Hacking :
* In this, the ethical hacker gains an unauthorized control of a web server, though the fundamental reason is to test the server and to identify its software vulnerabilities. They collect the information about the relevant target which involves the process of identifying the target system and collecting the details like IP address, operating system, hardware, network configuration & infrastructure, DNS records etc.
# Conclusion:
* Ethical hacking can help in lot of ways like it strengthens computer and network security by performing penetration testing, it enables one to take preventive measures to avoid any security breach situations. Lastly I would conclude by saying that the list of benefits provided by ethical hackers is quite a big therefore Ethical hack Hackers are very much in demand.
